In this tutorial I will cover a few strategies to create Django user sign up/registration. Usually I implement it from scratch. 
You will see itâ€™s very straightforward.  For the examples I will use an empty Django project named mysite. Inside the mysite folder I created an app named core. So every time you see mysite and/or core, change to the suitable project name and app name.
